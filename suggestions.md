1) move download buttons to bottom right of image or add outline to make buttons pop, 
2)add sound adjustment for window for sounds
3)profiles card too big, can clean up and remove drop down menu and reformat how information is displayed, add options to delete individual mods from profile ( trash can on list)
5) figure out exact pixel mapping of crosshairs and calculate based on resolution
5) remove autoconfigure gameinfo.gi from preferences as we already handle it in game configuraiton card, add are you sure screen to developer mode
6) fix sizing of character name typescript in locker tab, ensure skins in locker tab gets maximum number of rsults given constraint to hero for skins, make skins selector more image based, potentially add lightweight animations for each image when clicking on it to make an immersive card click, animate image to pop out and to the right with animations on the left coming from right side of screen (this needs to be planned more in depth)
